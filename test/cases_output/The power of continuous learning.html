        <h1>The power of continuous learning</h1><div><p>During my first 2.5 years at OpenAI, I worked on the Robotics team on a moonshot idea: we wanted to teach a single, human-like robot hand to solve Rubik’s cube. It was a tremendously exciting, challenging, and emotional experience. We <a href="https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/">solved</a> the challenge with deep reinforcement learning (RL), crazy amounts of domain randomization, and no real-world training data. More importantly, we conquered the challenge as a team.</p><p>From simulation and RL training to vision perception and hardware firmware, we collaborated so closely and cohesively. It was an amazing experiment and during that time, I often thought of Steve Jobs’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">reality distortion field</a>: when you believe in something so strongly and keep on pushing it so persistently, somehow you can make the impossible possible.</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, I started leading the Applied AI Research team. Managing a team presents a different set of challenges and requires working style changes. I’m most proud of several projects related to language model safety within Applied AI:</p><ol><li>We designed and constructed a set of evaluation data and tasks to assess the tendency of pre-trained language models to generate hateful, sexual, or violent content.</li><li>We created a detailed taxonomy and built a strong classifier to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-content-moderation-tooling/">detect unwanted content</a> as well as the reason why the content is inappropriate.</li><li>We are working on various techniques to make the model less likely to generate unsafe outputs.</li></ol><p>As the Applied AI team is practicing the best way to deploy cutting-edge AI techniques, such as large pre-trained language models, we see how powerful and useful they are for real-world tasks. We are also aware of the importance of safely deploying the techniques, as emphasized in <a href="https://openai.com/charter/">our Charter</a>.</p></div>
