        <h1>Our approach to AI safety</h1><div><p>We believe that a practical approach to solving AI safety concerns is to dedicate more time and resources to researching effective mitigations and alignment techniques and testing them against real-world abuse.</p><p>Importantly, we also believe that improving AI safety and capabilities should go hand in hand. Our best safety work to date has come from working with our most capable models because they are better at following users’ instructions and easier to steer or “guide.”</p><p>We will be increasingly cautious with the creation and deployment of more capable models, and will continue to enhance safety precautions as our AI systems evolve.</p><p>While we waited over 6 months to deploy GPT-4 in order to better understand its capabilities, benefits, and risks, it may sometimes be necessary to take longer than that to improve AI systems' safety. Therefore, policymakers and AI providers will need to ensure that AI development and deployment is governed effectively at a global scale, so no one cuts corners to get ahead. This is a daunting challenge requiring both technical and institutional innovation, but it’s one that we are eager to contribute to.</p><p>Addressing safety issues also requires extensive debate, experimentation, and engagement, including on the <a href="/blog/how-should-ai-systems-behave">bounds</a> of AI system behavior. <a href="/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-language-models">We have and will continue to foster collaboration</a> and open dialogue among stakeholders to create a safe AI ecosystem.<br></p></div>
