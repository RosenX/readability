        <h1>Governance of superintelligence</h1><div><p>But the governance of the most powerful systems, as well as decisions regarding their deployment, must have strong public oversight. We believe people around the world should democratically decide on the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/how-should-ai-systems-behave">bounds and defaults</a> for AI systems. We don't yet know how to design such a mechanism, but <a href="/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai">we plan to experiment</a> with its development. We continue to think that, within these wide bounds, individual users should have a lot of control over how the AI they use behaves.</p><p>Given the risks and difficulties, it’s worth considering why we are building this technology at all.</p><p>At OpenAI, we have two fundamental reasons. First, we believe it’s going to lead to a much better world than what we can imagine today (we are already seeing early examples of this in areas like education, creative work, and personal productivity). The world faces a lot of problems that we will need much more help to solve; this technology can improve our societies, and the creative ability of everyone to use these new tools is certain to astonish us. The economic growth and increase in quality of life will be astonishing.</p><p>Second, we believe it would be unintuitively risky and difficult to stop the creation of superintelligence. Because the upsides are so tremendous, the cost to build it decreases each year, the number of actors building it is rapidly increasing, and it’s inherently part of the technological path we are on, stopping it would require something like a global surveillance regime, and even that isn’t guaranteed to work. So we have to get it right.<br></p></div>
