        <div><h1>Introducing ChatGPT and Whisper APIs</h1><!--[-->
            <p>ChatGPT and Whisper models are now available on our API, giving developers access to
                            cutting-edge language (not just chat!) and speech-to-text capabilities. Through a series of
                            system-wide optimizations, we’ve achieved 90% cost reduction for ChatGPT since December;
                            we’re now passing through those savings to API users. Developers can now use our open-source
                            Whisper large-v2 model in the API with much faster and cost-effective results. ChatGPT API
                            users can expect continuous model improvements and the option to choose dedicated capacity
                            for deeper control over the models. We’ve also listened closely to feedback from our
                            developers and refined our API terms of service to better meet their needs.<br></p>

                            behavior, has 750 million monthly Snapchatters:<br></p>

                          <p><strong>Model</strong>: The ChatGPT model family we are releasing today,
                            <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>, is the same model used in the ChatGPT product. It is priced at
                            $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is 10x cheaper than our existing GPT-3.5 models. It’s also our
                            best model for many non-chat use cases—we’ve seen early testers migrate from
                            <code>text-davinci-003</code> to <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> with only a small amount of
                            adjustment needed to their prompts.

                          <p><span><br></span><strong>API</strong>: Traditionally, GPT models consume
                            unstructured text, which is represented to the model as a sequence of “tokens.” ChatGPT
                            models instead consume a sequence of messages together with metadata. (For the curious:
                            under the hood, the input is still rendered to the model as a sequence of “tokens” for the
                            model to consume; the raw format used by the model is a new format called <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md">Chat Markup Language</a> (“ChatML”).)</p>

            <p><h2>ChatGPT upgrades</h2></p>
            <p>We are constantly improving our ChatGPT models, and want to make these enhancements
                            available to developers as well. Developers who use the <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> model
                            will always get our recommended stable model, while still having the flexibility to opt for
                            a specific model version. For example, today we’re releasing
                            <code>gpt-3.5-turbo-0301</code>, which will be supported through at least June 1st, and
                            we’ll update <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> to a new stable release in April. The <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">models page</a> will provide switchover updates.<br>
                          </p>
            <p><h2>Dedicated instances</h2></p>
            <div>
                          <p>We are also now offering dedicated instances for users who want deeper control over the
                            specific model version and system performance. By default, requests are run on compute
                            infrastructure shared with other users, who pay per request. Our API runs on Azure, and with
                            dedicated instances, developers will pay by time period for an allocation of compute
                            infrastructure that’s reserved for serving their requests.</p>
                          <p>Developers get full control over the instance’s load (higher load improves throughput but
                            makes each request slower), the option to enable features such as longer context limits, and
                            the ability to pin the model snapshot.</p>
                          <p>Dedicated instances can make economic sense for developers running beyond ~450M tokens per
                            day. Additionally, it enables&nbsp;directly optimizing a developer’s workload
                            against&nbsp;hardware performance, which can dramatically reduce costs relative to shared
                            infrastructure. For dedicated instance inquiries, <a href="https://openai.com/contact-sales/">contact

                            We’ve now made the large-v2 model available through our API, which gives convenient

                          <p>We believe that AI can provide incredible opportunities and economic empowerment to
                            everyone, and the best way to achieve that is to allow everyone to build with it. We hope
                            that the changes we announced today will lead to numerous applications that everyone can
                            benefit from. Start building next-generation apps powered by ChatGPT &amp; Whisper.<br></p>
