Technology shapes the lives of individuals, how we interact with one another, and how society as a whole evolves. We believe that decisions about how AI behaves should be shaped by diverse perspectives reflecting the public interest.&nbsp;</p><p>​​Laws encode values and norms to regulate behavior. Beyond a legal framework, AI, much like society, needs more intricate and adaptive guidelines for its conduct. For example: under what conditions should AI systems condemn or criticize public figures, given different opinions across groups regarding those figures? How should disputed views be represented in AI outputs? Should AI by default reflect the persona of a median individual in the world, the user’s country, the user’s demographic, or something entirely different? No single individual, company, or even country should dictate these decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://openai.com/charter">AGI</a> should benefit all of humanity and be shaped to be as inclusive as possible. We are launching this grant program to take a first step in this direction. We are seeking teams from across the world to develop proof-of-concepts for a democratic process that could answer questions about what rules AI systems should follow. We want to learn from these experiments, and use them as the basis for a more global, and more ambitious process going forward. While these initial experiments are not (at least for now) intended to be binding for decisions, we hope that they explore decision relevant questions and build novel democratic tools that can more directly inform decisions in the future.</p><p>The <a href="https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence">governance of the most powerful systems</a>, as well as decisions regarding their deployment, must have strong public oversight. This grant represents a step to establish democratic processes for overseeing AGI and, ultimately, superintelligence. It will be provided by the OpenAI non-profit organization, and the results of the studies will be freely accessible.</p></div><div><h2>What do we mean by a “democratic process”?</h2></div><div><p>By “democratic process,” we mean a process in which a broadly representative group of people<span><sup></sup><span>[A]</span></span></p><div><p>How one selects the group of participants is a critical design question. Part of this grant challenge lies in determining questions about participation. For instance, policy questions involving minority groups may require an increased representation of group members, while questions about the impact of technology on children might necessitate the involvement of domain experts such as educators and psychologists. Moreover, certain questions might be better suited for responses from populations within specific geographical boundaries in order to address localized policy issues.</p></div>&nbsp;exchange opinions, engage in deliberative discussions,<span><sup></sup><span><span>[B]</span><div><p>Deliberation can be described as a process that uncovers opinions, helping the discussants understand each other's views and reconsider and update their viewpoints. Well-designed deliberation ensures that arguments are well understood by all sides, and are based on people's values rather than superficial misunderstandings. Successful deliberation results in participants reaching a higher level of consensus, and/or reaching deeper levels of understanding for differing perspectives.</p></div></span></span>&nbsp;and ultimately decide on an outcome via a transparent decision making process.<span><sup></sup><span><span>[C]</span><div><p>There are many decision-making algorithms to be considered here, such as electing representatives, majority voting, employing <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30794">liquid democracy</a>, and making decisions by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/14/voting-undermines-the-will-of-the-people-its-time-to-replace-it-with-sortition">random population sample</a>, also known as a jury or <a href="https://harvardpolitics.com/sortition-in-america/">sortition</a>.</p></div></span></span> There are many ways such a process could be structured—we encourage applicants to be innovative, building off known methodologies, and coming up with wholly new approaches. Examples of creative approaches that inspire us include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/12/twitter-begins-rolling-out-its-community-notes-feature-globally/">Twitter Community Notes</a>, <a href="https://demnext.org/">DemocracyNext</a>, <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/towards-platform-democracy-policymaking-beyond-corporate-ceos-and-partisan-pressure">Platform Assemblies</a>, <a href="https://gateway.metagov.org/">MetaGov</a>, <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/">RadicalxChange</a>, <a href="https://www.peoplepowered.org/">People Powered</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00672.pdf">Collective Response Systems</a>, and <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/Case-studies/">pol.is</a>. Another notable ongoing effort is led by the<a href="https://cip.org/"> Collective Intelligence Project </a>(CIP), with whom we are partnering on public input to AI, contributing to their upcoming <a href="https://cip.org/alignmentassemblies">Alignment Assemblies</a>. We also encourage applicants to envision how AI could <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00672.pdf">enhance</a> the democratic process. For example, AI could <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15006">enable</a> more efficient communication among numerous people.</div><div><p>Several issues can undermine democratic processes, such as the failure to adequately represent minority or majority groups, manipulation by special interest groups, insufficiently informed participants, or <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4266250">participation</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02423">washing</a>. We are looking for teams who proactively address these failure modes, and demonstrate awareness of the potential flaws and downsides of various approaches. Ultimately, designing truly democratic processes is a high bar to meet, and we view our efforts as complements rather than substitutes for regulation of AI by governments; this program encourages best-effort, democratic-in-spirit processes involving deliberation and broad public input as stepping stones.</p></div><div><h2>Instructions for participation</h2></div><div><p>To apply for a grant, we invite you to submit the required application material by 9:00 pm PDT June 24, 2023.

They may also create their own questions if desired. Importantly, we encourage teams to consider questions for which a simple “yes” or “no” answer would be inadequate, necessitating a nuanced policy proposal instead.</p><p>The scope of this grant pertains to policy questions concerning model behavior, as it enables A/B tests with modified model behavior according to the policy recommendations. We acknowledge the limitations of this grant and recognize that numerous AI issues could be addressed through the democratic process, extending beyond model behavior to include areas such as guidelines for the use of AI in various contexts, economic impact, distribution of benefits and more.</p><ul><li><em>How far do you think personalization of AI assistants like ChatGPT to align with a user’s tastes and preferences should go?
