            <div>
                          <p>In line with our <a href="https://production.openai.com/research/language-model-safety-and-misuse">iterative deployment</a> philosophy, we are gradually rolling
                            out plugins in ChatGPT so we can study their real-world use, impact, and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research">safety and alignment</a> challenges—all of which
                            we’ll have to get right in order to achieve <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">our mission</a>.</p>
                          <p>Users have been asking for plugins since we launched ChatGPT (and many developers are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07842">experimenting</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761">with</a> <a href="https://www.adept.ai/act">similar</a> <a href="https://langchain.readthedocs.io/">ideas</a>) because they unlock a vast range of possible use cases. We’re
                            starting with a small set of users and are planning to gradually roll out larger-scale
                            access as we learn more (for plugin developers, ChatGPT users, and after an alpha period,
                            API users who would like to integrate plugins into their products). We’re excited to build a
                            community shaping the future of the human–AI interaction paradigm.</p>
                          <p>Plugin developers who have been invited off our waitlist can use our <a href="http://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/introduction">documentation</a> to build a plugin for ChatGPT, which then lists the
                            enabled plugins in the prompt shown to the language model as well as documentation to
                            instruct the model how to use each. The first plugins have been created by <a href="https://www.expedia.com/">Expedia</a>, <a href="https://fiscalnote.com/">FiscalNote</a>,

                    <p></p>
            <div>
                          <p>Language models today, while useful for a variety of tasks, are still limited. The only
                            information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date
                            and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models
                            can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to
                            actually follow these instructions you need another process.</p>
                          <p>Though not a perfect analogy, plugins can be “eyes and ears” for language models, giving
                            them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included
                            in the training data. In response to a user’s explicit request, plugins can also enable
                            language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the
                            usefulness of the system overall.</p>
                          <p>We expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an
                            AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look
                            like, and we’re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.</p>
                          <p>Today, we’re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators
                            for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We’re also beginning to roll out
                            the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.</p>
                          <p>In the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety
                            systems, we’ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI
                            models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.<br></p>

                          <p>Connecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as
                            significant <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf">new risks</a>.</p>
                          <p>Plugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language
                            models, including “hallucinations,” keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with
                            permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external
                            data—such as up-to-date information&nbsp;online, code-based calculations, or custom
                            plugin-retrieved information—language models can strengthen their responses with
                            evidence-based references.</p>
                          <p>These references not only enhance the model’s utility but also enable users to assess the
                            trustworthiness of the model’s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating
                            risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf">system card</a>. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond
                            addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging
                            from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.</p>
                          <p>At the same time, there’s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking
                            harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud,
                            mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may
                            raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the
                            model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin
                            platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.</p>

                          <p>We’ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators,
                            that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers
                            discovered ways for plugins—if released without safeguards—to perform sophisticated prompt
                            injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse
                            information sent to the plugin. We’re using these findings to inform safety-by-design
                            mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when
                            they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform
                            our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.</p>
                          <p>If you’re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we

                          <p>Plugins will likely have wide-ranging societal implications. For example, we recently
                            released a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130">working paper</a> which found that language models with access to tools
                            will likely have much greater economic impacts than those without, and more generally, in

                    </div>
            <div>
                          <p>Motivated by past work (our own <a href="https://openai.com/research/webgpt">WebGPT</a>, as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11147">GopherCite</a>, <a href="https://parl.ai/projects/blenderbot2/">BlenderBot2</a>, <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/01/lamda-towards-safe-grounded-and-high.html">LaMDA2</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14375.pdf">others</a>), allowing language models to read information from the
                            internet strictly expands the amount of content they can discuss, going beyond the training
                            corpus to fresh information from the present day.</p>
                          <p>Here’s an example of the kind of experience that browsing opens up to ChatGPT users, that
                            previously would have had the model politely point out that its training data didn’t include
                            enough information to let it answer. This example, in which ChatGPT retrieves recent
                            information about the latest Oscars, and then performs now-familiar ChatGPT poetry feats, is
                            one way that browsing can be an additive experience.<br></p>

            <p>In addition to providing obvious utility to end-users, we think enabling language and chat

                      </p><h3>Safety considerations</h3>
                    <p></p>
            <div>
                          <p>We’ve created a web browsing plugin which gives a language model access to a web browser,
                            with its design prioritizing both safety and operating as a good citizen of the web. The
                            plugin’s text-based web browser is limited to making GET requests, which reduces (but does
                            not eliminate) certain classes of safety risks. This scopes the browsing plugin to be useful
                            for retrieving information, but excludes “transactional” operations such as form submission
                            which have more surface area for security and safety issues.</p>
                          <p>Browsing retrieves content from the web using the Bing search API.&nbsp;As a result, we
                            inherit substantial work from Microsoft on (1) source reliability and truthfulness of
                            information and (2) “safe-mode” to prevent the retrieval of problematic content. The plugin
                            operates within an isolated service, so ChatGPT’s browsing activities are separated from the
                            rest of our infrastructure.</p>
                          <p>To respect content creators and adhere to the web’s norms, our browser plugin’s user-agent
                            token is <a href="https://openai.com/bot">ChatGPT-User</a> and is configured to honor websites' robots.txt files.
                            This may occasionally result in a “click failed” message, which indicates that the plugin is
                            honoring the website's instruction to avoid crawling it. This user-agent will only be used
                            to take direct actions on behalf of ChatGPT users and is not used for crawling the web in
                            any automatic fashion. We have also published our <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/production/ip-egress-ranges">IP egress ranges</a>. Additionally,
                            rate-limiting measures have been implemented to avoid sending excessive traffic to
                            websites.<br></p>
                        </div>
            <div>
                      <p>
                        <span>Click failed</span>
                      </p><span>You can block ChatGPT crawling your site
                        using the
                        robots.txt file, ChatGPT will show this error message when this happens.</span>
                    </div>
            <p>Our browsing plugin shows websites visited and cites its sources in ChatGPT’s responses.
                            This added layer of transparency helps users verify the accuracy of the model’s responses
                            and also gives credit back to content creators. We appreciate that this is a new method of
                            interacting with the web, and welcome feedback on additional ways to drive traffic back to
                            sources and add to the overall health of the ecosystem.<br></p>

            <p>We provide our models with a working Python interpreter ina sandboxed,

                            chat conversation (with an upper-bound timeout) and subsequent calls can build on top of
                            each other. We support uploading files to the current conversation workspace and downloading

            <div>
                          <p>We would like our models to be able to use their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374">programming</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774">skills</a> to provide a much more natural interface to most fundamental

                    <p></p>
            <p>The primary consideration for connecting our models to a programming language interpreter
                            is properly sandboxingthe execution so that AI-generated code does not
                            have unintended side-effects in the real world. We execute code in a secured environment and
                            use strict network controls to prevent external internet access from executed code.
                            Additionally, we have set resource limits on each session. Disabling internet access limits

                            designed as a safety-first method of connecting our models to the outside world.<br></p>

            <div>
                          <p>The open-source retrieval plugin enables ChatGPT to access personal or organizational
                            information sources (with permission). It allows users to obtain the most relevant document
                            snippets from their data sources, such as files, notes, emails or public documentation, by
                            asking questions or expressing needs in natural language.</p>
                          <p>As an open-source and self-hosted solution, developers can deploy their own version of the
                            plugin and register it with ChatGPT. The plugin leverages <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings">OpenAI embeddings</a> and allows developers to choose a vector database
                            (<a href="https://milvus.io/">Milvus</a>, <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a>, <a href="https://qdrant.tech/">Qdrant</a>, <a href="https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/vectors/">Redis</a>, <a href="https://weaviate.io/">Weaviate</a> or <a href="https://zilliz.com/">Zilliz</a>) for indexing and searching documents.

                    <p></p>
            <p>The retrieval plugin allows ChatGPT to search a vector database of content, and add the
                            best results into the ChatGPT session. This means it doesn’t have any external effects, and
                            the main risk is data authorization and privacy. Developers should only add content into
                            their retrieval plugin that they are authorized to use and can share in users’ ChatGPT
                            sessions.<br></p>

                              an existing API, or a wrapper around an existing API specifically designed for LLMs).</li>
                            <li>Create an OpenAPI specification documenting your API, and a manifest file that links to
                              the OpenAPI spec and includes some plugin-specific metadata.</li>
                          </ol>
                          <p>When starting a conversation on <a href="https://chat.openai.com">chat.openai.com</a>, users can choose which third-party plugins they’d
                            like to be enabled. Documentation about the enabled plugins is shown to the language model
                            as part of the conversation context, enabling the model to invoke appropriate plugin APIs as
                            needed to fulfill user intent. For now, plugins are designed for calling backend APIs, but
                            we are exploring plugins that can call client-side APIs as well.<br></p>
