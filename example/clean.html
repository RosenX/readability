        <h1>Function calling and other API updates</h1><div><p>Developers can now describe functions to <code>gpt-4-0613</code> and <code>gpt-3.5-turbo-0613</code>, and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. This is a new way to more reliably connect GPT's capabilities with external tools and APIs.</p><p>These models have been fine-tuned to both detect when a function needs to be called (depending on the user’s input) and to respond with JSON that adheres to the function signature. Function calling allows developers to more reliably get structured data back from the model. For example, developers can:</p><ul><li>Create chatbots that answer questions by calling external tools (e.g., like ChatGPT Plugins)</li></ul><p>Convert queries such as “Email Anya to see if she wants to get coffee next Friday” to a function call like <code>send_email(to: string, body: string)</code>, or “What’s the weather like in Boston?” to <code>get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit')</code>.</p><ul><li>Convert natural language into API calls or database queries</li></ul><p>Convert “Who are my top ten customers this month?” to an internal API call such as <code>get_customers_by_revenue(start_date: string, end_date: string, limit: int)</code>, or “How many orders did Acme, Inc. place last month?” to a SQL query using <code>sql_query(query: string)</code>.</p><ul><li>Extract structured data from text</li></ul><p>Define a function called <code>extract_people_data(people: [{name: string, birthday: string, location: string}])</code>, to extract all people mentioned in a Wikipedia article.</p><p>These use cases are enabled by new API parameters in our <code>/v1/chat/completions</code> endpoint, <code>functions</code> and <code>function_call</code>, that allow developers to describe functions to the model via JSON Schema, and optionally ask it to call a specific function. Get started with our <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling">developer documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openai/evals">add evals</a> if you find cases where function calling could be improved<br></p></div>
