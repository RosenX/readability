    <h1>New ways to manage your data in ChatGPT</h1><!--[-->
    <p>We've introduced the ability to turn off chat history in ChatGPT. Conversations that are started when chat
      history is disabled won’t be used to train and improve our models, and won’t appear in the history sidebar. These
      controls, which are rolling out to all users starting today, can be found in ChatGPT’s settings and can be changed
      at any time. We hope this provides an easier way to manage your data than our existing opt-out process. When chat
      history is disabled, we will retain new conversations for 30 days and review them only when needed to monitor for
      abuse, before permanently deleting.<br></p>

      <p>We are also working on a new ChatGPT Business subscription for professionals who need more control over their
        data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users. ChatGPT Business will follow our <a
          href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies">API’s data usage policies</a>, which means that end
        users’ data won’t be used to train our models by default. We plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the
        coming months.</p>
      <p>Finally, a new Export option in settings makes it much easier to export your ChatGPT data and understand what
        information ChatGPT stores. You’ll receive a file with your conversations and all other relevant data in
        email.<br></p>
